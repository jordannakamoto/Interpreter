## Stages
* Comment Removal
* Tokenization (definition and identification of tokens)
* Parsing into Concrete Syntax Tree (syntax checking and statement modeling)
* Parsing into Abstract Syntax Tree (program instruction modeling)
* Symbol Table (function, variable, parameter list, scope modeling)
* Interpretation (runtime evaluation, stack memory management, and control flow)

### Build Instructions
* Makefile will build executable as "app" in root directory

Example run:
`make all`
`./app tests/inputs/test1.c`

**Input File**
``` c
// ***************************************************
// * CS460: Programming Assignment 6: Test Program 1 *
// ***************************************************

function int sum_of_first_n_squares (int n)
{
  int sum;

  sum = 0;
  if (n >= 1)
  {
    sum = n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6;
  }
  return sum;
}
  
procedure main (void)
{
  int n;
  int sum;

  n = 100;
  sum = sum_of_first_n_squares (n);
  printf ("sum of the squares of the first %d numbers = %d\n", n, sum);
}

```

**Program Output**
``` c
sum of the squares of the first 100 numbers = 338350
```

**Batch Testing:**
* Shell script runall will run ./app for all test .c files from tests/input directory
* Shell script testall will run diff for all tests/program-outputs files against corresponding .txts in tests/outputs
requiring chmod x to execute


## Design Philosophy
As an educational program, the code is designed to be simple with focus placed on modularity and encapsulation of key concepts.

A general C++ programming pattern was used for both ease of development and final program flow.
* Each **Stage** of parsing or processing has a class, for example `Tokenizer`
* Getter/Setter functions access class functionality
* The class is called by main.cpp during each stage along with its printing and output file methods
* A Stage class may be accompanied by utility classes or requisite data structures defined or linked in the header file
* Each stage .cpp has a primary procedure of a descriptive name which performs its task

  
<br><br> **The general class template is as follows:**
* Generally each stage works with a **Tree** of elements represented by a **Linked List** arrangement of **Nodes**
* The Tree held by each stage interacts in various ways with other stages by accessing Nodes.
* Sibling-Child links are used
* Siblings form a group of elements which represent a unit of that Stage's responsibility
* For example the assignment: `n = 100` is constructed as 3 siblings
* Child relationships represent sibling rows connected as descendants from the root
* A **Node** struct is used to define a Tree element to describe its relative position for traversal and its data storage container
* **enums** are used to describe elementary types or unique states and are derived from rough DFA based analysis.
* **Tokens** as a storage mechanism are reused throughout the program to reduce the complexity of type management.
* A Token stores information on **Type** and **Value**, from which we can produce handling rules. Each stage uses various ranges of Types.
* A main class body procedure constructs the Stage's Tree and is composed of various **handler methods**.
* switch case or if/else controls are used to branch the body procedure based on incoming Sibling-Child Node **relationships** or statements from the previous Stage
* A preprocessing phase may occur before the body
* The **print** and **File Handler** methods are defined below the body.
